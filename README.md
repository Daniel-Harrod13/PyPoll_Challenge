# Election_Analysis 

## Project Overview
In this project we were tasked with using python 3.6.1 and voting data from election_results.csv to run an audit of the results a congressional seat election.
## Resources
Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38 .1

## Results
Upon completeing our PyPoll_Challenge it was determined that:
- There were 369,711 votes casted in total
- Denver county had the biggest turnout with 82% of the votes measured
- The three canidates and their number of votes recieved were as follows: 
- Stockham with 85,213 or 23.03%
- DeGette with 272, 892 or 73.8%
- Doane 11,606 or 3.1 %
## Summary
Upon examing the data we can see that DeGette was the overall winner of the Congressional seat. Upon reviewing this source code provided in these files, and knowing that elections are held or conducted in the same manner across the country, we could use these tools to count many more elcetions. By simply downloading the data package of said election and modifying this code to match variable names such as canidate names, counties, and any other changes in cllections we would be able produce a replica of this data set but with the new election results.
